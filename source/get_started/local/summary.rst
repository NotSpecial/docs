**Congratulations!** You just built your first Thot project, building it from scratch and analyzing the data to come to a final conclusion. We've only touched on the functionality of Thot, and with such a small project it's hard to get a sense of the power thot gives you in analyzing larger projects. To learn more about this you can go through the advanced tutorial (coming soon) and learn even more.

	.. group-tab:: desktop

		In this tutorial you learned how to build a local Thot project using Thot Desktop. We saw the **Project** and **File Tree** views and how we can perform the same task in multiple ways. We began by creating our project tree using Conainers. We then added data to our project by add Assets to our Containers. Then we learned how to write an analysis script. We used Thot to pull in the data we wanted and used properties of the Assets. Finally, we created Script Associations between Containers and the Scripts to run on them and analyzed our project.

		In this tutorial you learned how to build a local Thot project by creating a folder structure and adding ``_container.json`` files to create Containers. We then added data to our project by creating Assets using ``_asset.json`` files which point to their data file. Then we learned how to write an analysis script. We used Thot to pull in the data we wanted and used properties of the Assets. Finally, we created ``_scripts.json`` files to create Script Associations between Containers and the Scripts to run on them, then analyzed our project.
